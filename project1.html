  <h3>Describe how search engines work</h3>
    <p>Search engines have several steps for a website to appear in the engine.The first step is when your website is discovered by a robot/crawler.	When a robot visits a website, it will analyze the data and send it to a large data storage center. The website’s code and appearance and numerous other factors determines how easily a website is found on a search engine.</p>
  <h3>importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h3>
    <p>Keywords are important in search engine because specify is crucial in products. If the product is very niche then it is very important to highlight because it will stand above the rest. Over 70% of a search engine’s clicks are focus on a few links. The remaining 30% of websites are fighting over attention. Many people do not even look at the second page of the search engine.</p>
  <h3>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links</h3>
    <p>Make sure the website is very user friendly such as having a clear navigation tab. Make sure the meta data and the title are concise. Make sure the website has corrected syntax and is compatible with different devices and browsers. Make sure the website is visual pleasing</p>
  <h3>Good heading hierarchy </h3>
    <p>Hierarchy is used to help the user navigate a website by having contrast to distinguish components. If ever thing is fighting over attention, then nothing important, the opposite is true if everything seems bland. Contrasting headings and colors help divide a webpage into comprehendible page.
